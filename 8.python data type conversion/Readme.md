**Implicit Type Conversion**

In Implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn't need any user involvement.

**Explicit Type Conversion**

In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to required data type. We use the predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.

This type of conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects.
